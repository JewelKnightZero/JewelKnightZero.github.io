            <b>This game was done as part of my Introduction to Game Design subject, focusing on game design principles and story, rather than just programming</b><br>
            You play as Detective Guppy, a detective who's been solving crimes on a global scale for years. While he is gruff and reserved he is able to communicate and see spirits ever since he was a wee little boy.

He has been tasked by Metro City's government to solve the oddjobs occuring throughout the city and their mysterious outbursts, being aquainted with the best police officer in town!

Explore each level, interrogate humans and spirits, and talk to the police officer when you think you have solved the crime! But cut the crap, you only get one chance to solve the case! Now go out there and kick some crime!
